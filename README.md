# Image Processing with Streamlit and OpenCV

This project allows users to upload an image and apply basic image processing techniques (grayscale conversion and edge detection) using OpenCV. The processed images are displayed in a web app built with **Streamlit**.

---

## üöÄ **Features**
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: The app converts the uploaded image to grayscale.
- **Edge Detection**: The app applies edge detection using the Canny algorithm.
- **Real-Time Display**: The original, grayscale, and edge-detected images are displayed in real-time.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**
- **Python**: The core programming language used.
- **Streamlit**: For building and deploying the web app.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing (grayscale conversion and edge detection).
- **NumPy**: For handling image data.
- **Pillow**: For image manipulation.
